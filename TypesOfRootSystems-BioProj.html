            <h1>Types of Root Systems</h1>
            <p>There are two main kinds of root systems: taproots and fibrous roots. Most taproots grow on dicots, or dicotyledons, and most fibrous roots grow on monocots, or monocotyledons. There are a few differences between monocots and dicots, but a simple way to tell is that monocots have long leaves with parallel veins, like grass, and dicots have broad leaves. Dicots can reach deeper into the soil than monocots can and are often found in places with less water available because they can reach the water underground. More differences are provided in the diagram below: (Fig. 1)</p>

                <figcaption>Fig. 2: Comparison of monocot and dicot root cross sections.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The roots of the monocot and dicot differ as well. In Fig. 2, you can see the monocot root on the left and the dicot root on the right. The dicot has a larger vascular cylinder than the monocot and the epidermis and endodermis are a lot more distinct in the dicot. Additionally there are root hairs coming off the edge of the dicot where there is no root hairs on the monocot. </p>
            <p>Before I researched during this project I had thought that bulbs are a root system and it interfered with my research because I kept trying to figure out how bulbs fit into the picture. Now I know that bulbs are <em>not</em> root systems, but rather storage structures for the plant. This is wonderfully displayed by the hyacinth, in which the roots and bulb are very distinctly separated by the basal plate, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig. 3: Hyacinth bulbs.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Here you can see that the bulb is separate from the roots.</p>
                <p>There is also another type of root, adventitious roots, which sprout from organs other than the root itself. Most monocots have adventitious roots, and a good example is the eyes of potatoes (potatoes are not roots, they are tubers, separate from the root system). Aerial roots are adventitious roots that go through the air at some point. Mangroves are perhaps the most famous example of aerial roots. Aerial roots can be used for soil support or for attaching to non-soil surfaces. When they are used for soil support, they can be called prop roots. </p>
