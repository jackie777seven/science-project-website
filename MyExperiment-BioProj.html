        <h1>Effect of Watering Method on Plant Growth</h1>
        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
        <p>I did an experiment on whether or not it matters how the roots of a plant receive water. I watered the plants in four different ways: Misting (with a hand-held mister), Pouring (water poured in next to the plant), Flooding (water concentrated on one day), and Bottom (water poured into the drainage plate). I did this experiment on a bush bean plant, <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>, also commonly known as the common bean. It is a dicot, and so has a taproot. I found that the watering method does matter, and the method affects the growth significantly.</p>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Does it matter how the roots of <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em> receive their water? And if so, how much does it affect it? This is an important question because, it seems, it is a question that is not often asked but the answer can provide significant insight to gardeners and farmers worldwide. I predicted that the Pouring method would be most effective.</p>
                <p>In this experiment, I will refer to each bean that received their respective methods of watering as the method name itself, for example the bean that received water from the bottom of the pot will be named Bottom.</p>
            <h3>METHODS</h3>
            <p>For all of the methods I gave an equivalent of 45mL of water every day in the morning. For the flooding technique, I watered 135mL then waited two days to water again, effectively getting the same amount of water as the other plants but just getting 3 days of water at the same time. I collected data about the height of each of the plants twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. </p>

            <h3 class="Analysis">DISCUSSION</h2>
            
            <p>The first thing that I want to mention is that some of the data points are illogically low. This is because the beans sometimes would lean over, and if I couldn't lean them up against the stick I had in each of the pots then I would measure the leaning bean. The beans themselves would rarely actually shrink (there are exceptions, which I will explain in a consequent paragraph) and you can tell which data points represent leaning beans by looking at the ones around it. Usually the data points to the left and right of the very low point look as if the low point hadn't happened at all or had been normal. </p>
            <p>In this experiment, Misting is the most effective on the growth of the bean, ending up almost twice as tall as Pouring. Bottom has the most interesting growth pattern, with semi-routine plateaus and bouts of growth, starting off with a very similar height to Flooding and Pouring but growing faster later. Bottom also leaned significantly most times before a growth spurt. Flooding and Pouring were pretty much identical except for the end.</p>
            <p>At the end of the period in which I collected data, every plant except Misting decreased it's height, most of all Pouring. The bean that received water by pouring did indeed shrink, and at the same time the leaves were shriveling up and getting darker, likely from lack of root space. I think that the reason why Pouring did this is similar to the reason why Misting was so successful growthwise and why Flooding and Pouring were so similar, except for the end bit. Observe the following diagrams: </p>

            <p>These diagrams represent the areas inside the pots that the water accessed. Bottom (Fig. 2) and Misting (Fig. 3) got water from the bottom and top, respectively, and Pouring (Fig. 4) and Flooding (Fig. 5) have only the area of water that differs.</p>
            <p>Looking at Bottom first, we see that the water is at the very bottom of the roots. Because of the generally triangular pattern of the taproot, the bottom roots are the smallest, and so will not be able to collect as much water as the top roots at first. But time will pass and the roots at the bottom will grow bigger and the ones at the top smaller, as they are not being used, and since the plant will be able to get more water, the plant will grow more. This explains the similarity in hieght to Flooding and Pouring at the beginning and the difference of hieght after a few days.</p>
            <p>Misting will have little to change as the most water is going to where the biggest roots are. This allows for the least amount of energy of moving the position of the roots to be used and more energy to be used actually collecting water. In other words, there is no break in between the time that the plant began receiving water and when the roots are in a good position for getting water, so more energy can be set aside for upward growth.</p>
            <p>Flooding has the most water area out of all of the plants. Having all the water concetrated at one point in time allows for there to be more water spread out throughout the pot. This way, roots will have more space to grow and still get water, even though there won't be as much. Compare this to Pouring, where the water is in a smaller space. Since I poured it around the bottom of the stem, most of the water went around the taproot, and this would create the least amount of places where the roots could go. When there is no more space where the roots can go, then the plant will suffer, thus causing the wrinkled, darkened leaves and decreased height. </p>
            <p>Of course, this is just a hypothesis and is not tested. I could test this by using clear pots, so that I could see where the roots go and where the water is. Further if I did this experiment again then I would have more plants, and therefore more data. It is possible that Misting was taller than the other plants because it had an allele for being tall, and it had nothing to do with the water method. As I only had one plant per method it is impossible to know for sure without more data.</p>
            <p>While my hypothesis was incorrect, the data was still insightful. Misting was the most effect watering method, and Pouring was the least. The watering technique could even bring about your plants' death, combined with insufficient root space. Different methods affect the growth of the plant by varying levels. Overall, </p>
