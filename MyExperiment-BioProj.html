        <h1>My Experiment</h1>
        <p>I did an experiment on whether or not it matters how the roots of a plant receive water. I watered the plants in four different ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Misting - Used a hand-held mister
                <li>Pouring - Water poured in next to the plant
                <li>Flooding - Longer periods in between waterings, and more water each watering
                <li>Bottom - Water poured into the drainage plate
            </ul>
            <p>I did this experiment on a bush bean plant, <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>, also commonly known as the common bean. It is a dicot, and so has a taproot.</p>
            <p>In this experiment, I will refer to each bean that received their respective methods of watering as the method name itself, for example the bean that received water from the bottom of the pot will be named Bottom.</p>
            <p>I predicted that the Pouring method would be most effective. I was wrong about thisâ€“in fact, so wrong that Pouring was the least effective in this experiment. I thought that Pouring would be the most effective because it seemed like the water would be able to get to all the roots more easily if all the water was poured right next to the plant and downward, thus collecting the most water compared to other methods. Misting and Bottom would not reach the roots enough, and Flooding would drown the plant.</p>
            <p>For all of the methods I gave an equivalent of 45mL of water every day in the morning. For the flooding technique, I watered 135mL then waited two days to water again, effectively getting the same amount of water as the other plants but just getting 3 days of water at the same time. I collected data about the height of each of the plants twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. </p>
            <p>Here is the raw data. This table represents the growth of each of the different beans receiving different water treatment over time: <a href="#Analysis"><span style="font-size:12px; color:black">(Skip the data, I want to see the analysis)</span></a></p>

            <p>The first thing that I want to mention is that some of the data points are illogically low. This is because the beans sometimes would lean over, and if I couldn't lean them up against the stick I had in each of the pots then I would measure the leaning bean. The beans themselves would rarely actually shrink (there are exceptions, which I will explain in a consequent paragraph) and you can tell which data points represent leaning beans by looking at the ones around it. Usually the data points to the left and right of the very low point look as if the low point hadn't happened at all or had been normal. </p>
            <p>In this experiment, Misting is the most effective on the growth of the bean, ending up almost twice as tall as Pouring. Bottom has the most interesting growth pattern, with semi-routine plateaus and bouts of growth. Bottom also leaned significantly most times before a growth spurt. Flooding and Pouring were pretty much identical except for the end.</p>
            <p>At the end of the period in which I collected data, every plant except Misting decreased it's height, most of all Pouring. The bean that received water by pouring did indeed shrink, and at the same time the leaves were shriveling up and getting darker. I think that the reason why Pouring did this is similar to the reason why Misting was so successful growthwise and why Flooding and Pouring were so similar, except for the end bit. Observe the following diagrams: <br></p>
